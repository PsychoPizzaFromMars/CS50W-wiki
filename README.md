# CS50W-wiki
[Wiki](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/1/wiki/) is a CS50W course learning project on edX, where I have implemented simple wikipedia-like web application.

What I have learned making this project:
- basic Django functionality
- Markdown syntax
- making wikipedia-like pages without Django models
